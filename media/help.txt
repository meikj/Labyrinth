What is Labyrinth?
------------------

Labyrinth is a puzzle game consisting of two game modes: Treasure Chase and
Letter Chase. At the moment, only Treasure Chase is supported.

The aim of Treasure Chase is to collect the treausure in as few rounds as
possible. A round consists of a player tile move, a player token move, and a
computer tile move. 

A tile move is when a players spare tile is inserted into a column or row on the
board. The row or column must NOT contain any immovable tiles, otherwise it
cannot be inserted there. A tile can be inserted from the top or bottom in the
case of a column. And a tile can be inserted from the left or right in the case
of a row. The tile that falls of the row or column becomes the new spare tile.

Also, you cannot insert the spare tile back into it's previous location (i.e.
insert column bottom 2, then insert column top 2). The computer is not allowed
to do this either. This ensures a stalemate cannot occur.

The spare tile can be rotated before placement - this does not take up a tile
move. It can be rotated by 90, 180 or 270 degrees.

A token move is simply moving the token to a traversable location (i.e. a tile
without any walls blocking). The computer does not have a token, only the player.
The computers job is just to make getting to the treasure harder. The token can also
transition 'pac-man' style - in other words, it can move to the other side of the
board if it is at an edge and there are no walls blocking entry.
