Labyrinth
=========

Labyrinth is a University of Strathclyde CS207 semester two paired programming project by Gareth Gill and John Meikle. This project is being developed in strict conformance with the description and specification as outlined by Clemens Kupke.

It is a puzzle game in which there are two ways of winning: finding a treasure chest or forming a word. The game takes place on a fixed size maze in which the player is able to travel. They are able to turn each tile on the grid by 90 degrees, however there are a certain number of tiles on the board which are fixed, thus not movable. The player has a choice of two moves: the tile move and the token move. The former allows a spare tile to be pushed into one row of the grid which results in another tile on the opposite side to fall off, thereby becoming the new spare tile. The latter involves the token moving to an arbitrary tile that is reachable from the token's current position without crossing through any wall. There is both a one player and a two player game mode.
